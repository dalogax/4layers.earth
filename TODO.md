## Phase 1: Ground Layer MVP

### 1.1 Layered UI & Navigation (Ground Layer Only)

Implement horizontal time scrolling for the Ground layer (using mock data initially).

Context: The Ground layer is the only active layer in Phase 1. The user should be able to scroll horizontally through a timeline (e.g., hours or days) to view different time slices of ground-related data.

Implementation details:
- Build a horizontal scrollable timeline UI component in the frontend (e.g., using a scrollable div, slider, or swipe gestures).
- Populate the timeline and data display with mock data (static or randomly generated) to enable UI development and testing before backend integration.
- As the user scrolls or swipes, update the displayed data and visuals to reflect the selected time.
- Ensure smooth transitions, clear time indicators, and responsive design for both desktop and mobile.
- The component should be modular so it can later consume real data from the backend.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Users can scroll or swipe horizontally to change the time context.
- [ ] The displayed data updates as the user scrolls.
- [ ] The timeline is visually clear and responsive.
- [ ] No backend or real data dependency at this stage; mock data is used throughout.
- [ ] Automated unit/integration tests cover the timeline UI and data update logic.

### 1.2 Data Integration (Ground Layer)

Define backend endpoints for Ground layer data and integrate real data sources (APIs) relevant to the Ground layer.

Context: The app needs to display real-time or recent ground-related environmental data (e.g., temperature, soil moisture, weather conditions) for the selected time slices.

Implementation details:
- Identify and document the required data fields for the Ground layer.
- Research and select suitable public APIs or data sources that provide this information.
- Implement backend endpoints in `server.js` to fetch, process, and serve this data to the frontend.
- Add error handling and caching to ensure reliability and performance.
- Provide clear API documentation for frontend consumption.
- Update the frontend to consume these endpoints, replacing mock data with real data.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Backend endpoints are available and documented.
- [ ] Data is fetched from real APIs and served to the frontend.
- [ ] The frontend displays real data for the Ground layer.
- [ ] Error handling and caching are implemented.
- [ ] Automated tests verify backend endpoints, data fetching, and frontend integration.

### 1.3 Layer Visualization (Ground Layer)

Design and implement the Ground layer’s visual components, applying color themes, gradients, and transitions.

Context: The Ground layer should have a distinct visual identity and clearly present its data in an engaging, user-friendly way.

Implementation details:
- Create modular UI components (e.g., cards, charts, icons) to display ground data.
- Use CSS, canvas, or SVG for gradients, backgrounds, and smooth transitions between time slices.
- Apply a unique color palette and style for the Ground layer, consistent with the app’s design language.
- Animate data and visual changes for a dynamic, modern experience.
- Ensure all visuals are responsive and accessible.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Ground layer visuals are distinct, attractive, and consistent.
- [ ] Data is presented clearly and updates smoothly.
- [ ] Visuals are responsive and accessible.
- [ ] Automated tests verify visual component rendering and data-driven updates.

### 1.4 Progressive Enhancement & Responsiveness

Ensure mobile-first, responsive design and add touch and keyboard navigation for the Ground layer.

Context: The app should work seamlessly on all devices and be accessible to all users.

Implementation details:
- Use responsive CSS (flexbox, grid, media queries) to adapt the layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Test and optimize the UI for different screen sizes and input methods.
- Implement touch gestures (swipe, tap) for navigation on mobile devices.
- Add keyboard navigation and focus management for accessibility.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] The app is fully usable and visually correct on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- [ ] Users can navigate using touch and keyboard.
- [ ] Accessibility best practices are followed.
- [ ] Automated tests verify responsiveness, touch, and keyboard navigation.

### 1.5 Performance & Accessibility

Optimize for fast loading, smooth animations, and accessibility features for the Ground layer.

Context: The app should load quickly, run smoothly, and be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

Implementation details:
- Minimize bundle size and optimize asset loading (e.g., lazy loading, compression).
- Use efficient rendering and animation techniques for smooth UI updates.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast, ARIA labels, and semantic HTML.
- Support screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] The app loads quickly and animations are smooth.
- [ ] Accessibility checks (contrast, ARIA, keyboard navigation) pass.
- [ ] Automated tests verify performance optimizations and accessibility features.
